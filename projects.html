            <p>I'm building very small (but cute, I think!) side projects that are either an attempt at art, or are a thing that I do in my spare time to practice.</p>
            <p>Still working on it right now, but there are a few to entertain yourself with for now!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Here you can find some of the projects I'm working on:</p>
            <ul>
                <h3><a href="https://haikus-by-dharja.netlify.app/">Haiku Generator</a></h3>
                <p>This is a fun project that I've been working on. A <a href="https://haikus-by-dharja.netlify.app">website that generates haikus</a>, the traditional Japanese poems, using the Datamuse API. It helped me to study a bit more about APIs, logic and data structures. The project is still in progress, but I'm very happy with the results so far.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Dharja/project-backend">E-commerce Store</a></h3>
                <p>This is a project I've been working on, that is a full-stack web application. It's a <a href="https://github.com/Dharja/project-backend">fake E-commerce store</a> , where you can buy products. I'm currently working on it. The objective of this project was to focus on the backend. You can also access the <a href="https://github.com/Dharja/project-backend">source code</a></p>
            </ul>
