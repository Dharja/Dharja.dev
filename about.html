            <p>I just ended an undergraduate degree in Full-Stack Development at CoderHouse. I learnt how to develop web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also learned how to work with databases and APIs. Also I learned how to work with react. currently I am learning how to work with Python.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I am available for freelance work in a <b>consulting</b> capacity (not as a full-time engineer), or as a tech advisor
            for your company. My areas of expertise are the web platform, creative
            applications and interactions, and usable machine learning. I care deeply about users,
            performance, accessibility, and having things be functional. I am especially interested in (creative)
            projects
            that help people create things, public sector organizations and non profits.</p>
            <p>If you'd like us to
            work together, check out the ways in which I can <a href="/work">help your company</a>.</p>

            <h3><span class="og">‚òéÔ∏é </span> Do you want to just say hi?</h3>
            <p>My social media hell of choice is <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Twitter</a>, where I'm pretty responsive.
            I also have a GitHub AMA <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a>
            where you can ask me things, or read what other people have asked me.
            If you really need to, you can send me an <a href="mailto:mdinculescu@gmail.com">email</a>,
            but know that it'll take me an embarassing time to reply.
            It's not you, it's misplaced anxiety.</p>
            <h3><span class="og">üìù </span> Are you a conference and need a bio?</h3>
            <p>Monica is a creative coder and recovering software engineer that likes to build silly things. In the past she's worked
            on Magenta, machine learning, web components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you.
            She is passionate about delightful user experiences, unreasonably excited about emoji, wary of web fonts, and will
            become your best friend if you bring her
            cheese. On second thought, she may be a mouse.</p>
            <p>If you need a headshot, I recommend <a href="https://meowni.ca/images/headshot.jpg">this
            one</a>. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.pujaarajan.com">Pujaa Rajan</a> for
            making me look like a respectable adult!)</p>
            <h3><span class="og">‚Åâ </span> What are these cute emoji?</h3>
            <p>
            Why, thank you for asking! They are from the original Docomo emoji set,
            from the birth of time (2001). A while back I made
            <a href="https://meowni.ca/posts/og-emoji-font/">a font of them</a>, and this year I
            decided I hadn't been using them enough.
